Problem statements 

Use a Random forrest classifier to predict whether a person is likely to
purchase a product based on certain features like age, gender, and estimated salary.

Random Forest is a powerful machine learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees 
during training and merges their results (through averaging or voting) to improve predictive 
accuracy and control overfitting. It is particularly well-suited for classification problems 
like this, where the outcome is binary:

0: The person does not purchase the product.
1: The person purchases the product.

Features and Data:

.Age: Represents the demographic characteristics of the customer.

.Gender: A categorical feature that might influence purchasing behavior.

.Estimated Salary: Provides insight into the financial capacity of the customer.

.Additional features (if available) could further enhance the model's performance, 
such as location, browsing history, or past purchase behavior.

Steps to Build the Model:

1.Data Collection: Collect relevant data on customers, including age, gender, and e
stimated salary, along with their purchase history (binary outcome).

2.Data Preprocessing:

i)Handle missing or inconsistent data.

ii)Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender) using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

iii)Normalize or standardize numerical features like age and salary to ensure uniformity.

3.Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and test sets (e.g., 80-20 split) to 
evaluate model performance.

4.Feature Engineering: Identify and transform additional features that may improve the model's 
accuracy.

5.Model Training: Use the Random Forest Classifier to train the model on the training dataset. 
Key parameters include:
i)Number of Trees (n_estimators): Determines how many decision trees to include.

ii)Maximum Depth (max_depth): Limits the depth of each tree to control overfitting.

iii)Criterion: Defines the function to measure tree splits (e.g., Gini impurity or entropy).

6.Model Evaluation: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC on 
the test set to measure performance.

7.Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize parameters like tree depth, number of estimators, and maximum 
features using grid search or randomized search to improve results.

8.Prediction: Deploy the model to predict purchase likelihood for new customers.

Challenges and Solutions:

i)Overfitting: Can occur if the model is too complex. Mitigate this by limiting tree depth or 
reducing the number of trees.

ii)Imbalanced Data: If the dataset contains significantly more non-purchasers than purchasers, 
techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or class weighting may be required.

iii)Interpretability: Random Forest models are less interpretable than simpler models. Use 
feature importance metrics and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to improve 
explainability.

Business Impact:

i)Targeted Marketing: Focus efforts on customers with a high likelihood of purchase, reducing 
wasted resources.

ii)Personalized Offers: Use predictions to tailor offers or discounts for individuals more 
likely to buy.

iii)Revenue Growth: Increase sales efficiency by prioritizing potential buyers.
